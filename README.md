# Customer Insights, Lookalike Model, and Clustering Analysis

# Project Overview 
This project analyzes customer and transaction data to provide actionable insights, recommend similar customers, and segment customers into distinct groups for better targeting.  

# Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Gained insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.  
- Identified top-performing regions, popular product categories, and customer spending habits.  

# Task 2: Lookalike Model
- Developed a recommendation model to suggest top 3 similar customers based on profile and transaction history.  
- Generated a map of lookalikes with similarity scores for targeted marketing.  

# Task 3: Customer Segmentation 
- Performed clustering to group customers into 4 meaningful segments using KMeans.  
- Evaluated cluster quality using Davies-Bouldin Index and visualized the results.  

# Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebooks for each task.  
- CSV file with lookalike recommendations.  
- Reports summarizing insights and clustering results.
